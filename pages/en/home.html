	<p>The Research Group on Software Engineering (GrES) is located at Computer Science Department of the Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR), Brazil. It is composed by professors, students and researchers of other participant universities.</p>

	<p>The main research interests are software testing and search based software engineering. Projects on software testing include topics, such as: test planning, debugging and fault localization, software reliability modeling, selection and prioritization of test cases, testing criteria and tools. Projects on Search Based Software Enginneering generally apply search based optimization algorithms, such as: Genetic Programming, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, NSGA-II, and other multi-objective algoritms for solving Software Engineering Problems, in diverse areas: software testing, planning, reliability, software design, etc.</p>
